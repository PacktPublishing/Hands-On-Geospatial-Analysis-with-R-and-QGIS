# Hands-On Geospatial Analysis with R and QGIS

This is the code repository for [Hands-On Geospatial Analysis with R and QGIS](packt UTM URL for the book), published by Packt.

**A beginnerâ€™s guide to manipulating, managing, and analyzing spatial data using R and QGIS 3.2.2**

## What is this book about?
Managing spatial data has always been challenging and it's getting more complex as the size of data increases. Spatial data is actually big data and you need different tools and techniques to work your way around to model and create different workflows. R and QGIS have powerful features that can make this job easier.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Install R and QGIS
* Get familiar with the basics of R programming and QGIS
* Visualize quantitative and qualitative data to create maps
* Find out the basics of raster data and how to use them in R and QGIS
* Perform geoprocessing tasks and automate them using the graphical modeler of QGIS

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
jan_price = c(10, 20, 30)
increase = c(1, 2, 3)
mar_price = jan_price + increase
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is great for geographers, environmental scientists, statisticians, and every professional who deals with spatial data. If you want to learn how to handle GIS and remote sensing data, then this book is for you. Basic knowledge of R and QGIS would be helpful but is not necessary.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
